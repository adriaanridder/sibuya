The code of computing a specific distribution of the Sibuya class. This is an exponential dispersion model with variance function V(m) = p(1-(1-m/p)^a)/a, for mean m>0, dispersion p>m and power a=1/(1+r), r=1,2,... The specific case takes r=1 (a=1/2). Details of this class can be found in

Shaul Bar-Lev, Gerard Letac, Ad Ridder (2023). A delineation of new classes of exponential dispersion models supported on the set of nonnegative integers.
